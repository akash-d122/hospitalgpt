  "Amit Sharma": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "explanation": "**1. Risk Level: HIGH**  \n\n**2. Brief Explanation:**  \nAmit Sharma has multiple significant comorbidities, including **diabetes mellitus type 2**, **hypertensive disorders**, **coronary heart disease (CHD)**, and **asthma**, with repeated entries for hypertension and diabetes. These conditions are strongly associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), complications from diabetes (e.g., nephropathy, retinopathy), and reduced respiratory function due to asthma. The presence of CHD and chronic hypertension/diabetes elevates his risk for severe outcomes, especially if these conditions are not well-managed.  \n\n**3. Recommended Actions:**  \n- **Immediate Monitoring:** Regular follow-ups with a primary care physician and specialists (cardiologist, endocrinologist) to manage blood pressure, blood glucose, and cardiac health.  \n- **Medication Adherence:** Ensure strict compliance with prescribed medications for diabetes (e.g., metformin), hypertension (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers), and asthma (e.g., inhaled bronchodilators).  \n- **Lifestyle Modifications:**  \n  - Adopt a low-sodium, low-sugar diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet).  \n  - Engage in supervised moderate exercise (e.g., walking) to improve cardiovascular and metabolic health.  \n  - Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption.  \n- **Screening for Complications:** Regular checks for diabetic complications (e.g., HbA1c, kidney function, retinal exams) and cardiovascular monitoring (e.g., lipid profile, ECG).  \n- **Asthma Management:** Use of rescue inhalers as needed, avoidance of triggers, and consideration of pulmonary function tests.  \n- **Patient Education:** Counsel on recognizing symptoms of acute complications (e.g., chest pain, hypoglycemia, asthma exacerbations) and seeking urgent care.  \n\n**Note:** The repeated entries for hypertension and diabetes suggest potential chronic or poorly controlled conditions, which necessitate urgent attention to prevent progressive organ damage.",

Brief Explanation**  \nPriya Rao has multiple high-risk comorbidities, including **hypertensive disorder (repeatedly noted)**, **diabetes mellitus type 2 (repeatedly noted)**, **coronary heart disease**, **thyroid disorder**, and **asthma**. These conditions significantly increase her risk for severe complications such as cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), kidney failure, diabetic complications (e.g., retinopathy, neuropathy), and respiratory issues.

  "Rakesh Patel": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "explanation": "**1. Risk Level:** HIGH  \n\n**2. Brief Explanation:**  \nRakesh Patel has multiple high-risk comorbidities, including **Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2)**, **hypertensive disorder (recurrent)**, **coronary heart disease (CHD)**, **thyroid disorder**, and **asthma**. These conditions significantly increase his risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), complications from diabetes (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy), and respiratory issues. The presence of **CHD** and **uncontrolled hypertension** is particularly concerning, as they are strong predictors of morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the overlap of DM2 and hypertension exacerbates risks for microvascular and macrovascular complications.  \n\n**3. Recommended Actions:**  \n- **Cardiovascular Monitoring:** Regular ECGs, lipid profile checks, and blood pressure monitoring to manage hypertension and assess CHD progression.  \n- **Diabetes Management:** HbA1c testing every 3 months, glucose monitoring, and optimization of antidiabetic medications (e.g., metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors) to reduce complications.  \n- **Hypertension Control:** Target blood pressure <130/80 mmHg with ACE inhibitors/ARBs (e.g., lisinopril) or calcium channel blockers, depending on renal function.  \n- **Thyroid Function Testing:** Annual TSH and free T4 levels to ensure thyroid hormone balance, as untreated thyroid disorders can worsen metabolic and cardiovascular risks.  \n- **Pulmonary Care:** Asthma action plan, inhaler use education, and avoidance of triggers. Consider pulmonary function tests if symptoms persist.  \n- **Lifestyle Interventions:** Weight management, low-sodium/low-sugar diet, structured exercise program, and smoking cessation (if applicable).  \n- **Specialist Referrals:** Endocrinology for diabetes/thyroid care, cardiology for CHD follow-up, and pulmonology for asthma management.  \n- **Screening:** Annual eye exams (for diabetic retinopathy), renal function tests (e.g., creatinine, albuminuria), and foot exams to prevent complications.  \n\nThis comprehensive approach aims to mitigate risks and improve long-term outcomes. Close coordination between healthcare providers is essential.",

Brief Explanation:**  \nSimran Kaur has multiple chronic conditions, including **Diabetes mellitus type 2**, **Hypertensive disorder**, **Coronary heart disease (CHD)**, **Thyroid disorder**, and **Asthma**. These conditions collectively elevate her risk for severe complications, such as cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), diabetic complications (e.g., neuropathy, retinopathy), and respiratory issues. The presence of **CHD** at a relatively young age (assuming 31 years old as of 2023) is particularly concerning, as it indicates significant cardiovascular burden.
