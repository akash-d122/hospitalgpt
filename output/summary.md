# Patient Analysis Summary

**Summary of Patient Data Analysis:**

- **Patient Demographics:**  
  - **Total:** 6 patients.  
  - **Age Distribution:** Predominantly middle-aged, with 3 patients aged 30-39, 2 aged 50-59, and 1 aged 20-29.  

- **Key Health Patterns:**  
  - **High Chronic Disease Burden:**  
    - **Hypertension (24 instances)** and **Type 2 Diabetes (18 instances)** are the most prevalent conditions, suggesting significant metabolic and cardiovascular risks.  
    - **Coronary Heart Disease (12 instances)** and **Asthma (18 instances)** also highlight cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities.  
  - **Multi-Morbidity:** Each patient likely has multiple conditions (e.g., average of ~14 diagnoses per patient if totals are aggregated), indicating complex care needs.  
  - **Less Common Conditions:** Conditions like **Chronic Kidney Disease**, **Peripheral Vascular Disease**, and **Diabetic Retinopathy** (6 instances each) may reflect complications of primary diagnoses (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).  

- **Data Inconsistencies to Clarify:**  
  - Disease instance counts (e.g., 24 hypertension cases for 6 patients) suggest either data entry errors (e.g., inflated counts) or non-patient-specific metrics (e.g., treatment episodes). Confirmation of data structure is critical for accurate interpretation.  

**Conclusion:** The cohort exhibits a high prevalence of chronic conditions, particularly in middle-aged patients, with notable multi-morbidity. However, data discrepancies (e.g., diagnosis counts vs. patient totals) require resolution to ensure validity.
