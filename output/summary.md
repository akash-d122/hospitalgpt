# Patient Analysis Summary

**Summary of Patient Data Analysis:**

- **Patient Demographics:**  
  - Total of 6 patients.  
  - **Age Distribution:** Primarily middle-aged adults: 3 patients aged 30-39 and 2 aged 50-59. One patient is in the 20-29 range.  

- **Key Condition Patterns:**  
  - **High Frequency of Chronic Conditions:**  
    - Hypertensive disorder (24 instances) and Diabetes mellitus type 2 (18 instances) are most prevalent, suggesting a focus on cardiovascular/metabolic management.  
    - Asthma (18 instances) and Coronary heart disease (12 instances) are also notable.  
  - **Less Common Conditions:**  
    - Chronic kidney disease, thyroid disorders, seasonal allergies, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic retinopathy (6 instances each).  

- **Data Discrepancy Note:**  
  - Condition counts (e.g., 24 for hypertension) exceed the total patient count (6), indicating potential data entry errors or a non-standard metric (e.g., repeated entries per patient or encounter-based tracking).  

- **Insights:**  
  - The cohort likely requires management of multiple chronic conditions, particularly hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular issues.  
  - Data validation is critical to clarify whether counts reflect patient prevalence, severity, or documentation frequency.  

**Conclusion:** This group highlights a high burden of chronic diseases, emphasizing the need for integrated care for metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory conditions. Data clarity is essential for accurate interpretation.
