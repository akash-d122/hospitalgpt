# Patient Analysis Summary

**Summary:**  
The cohort of 6 patients is predominantly middle-aged, with 40% (n=2) aged 50-59 and 33% (n=2) aged 30-39. Hypertensive disorder (18 cases) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (12 cases) are the most prevalent conditions, followed by coronary heart disease, thyroid disorder, and asthma (6 cases each). Notably, comorbidities are common, as total condition counts (54) far exceed the number of patients, indicating multiple diagnoses per individual. This highlights a high burden of chronic, interrelated conditions in this group.
